CRESCENDO CONFLICT GDD

-Players control Musical instraments duealing in a stage
    -may move up-down-left-right in a 2D top-down arena
        ->may only move freely in "stage" area
            -open rectangle in middle of stage
        ->may NOT move into "audiance" area
            -a larger rectangle around the stage 
    -may shoot musical waves in any of 360 degrees
        -always fire "forward" relative to character position

-Waves
    -move in a straing line until conlision
    -grow linearly with time
    -on colsion with:
        -door (predetermined parts of the outer edge of the audiance)
            -cease to exist
        -wall 
            ->bounce
        -other wave
            ->bounce
        -player character
            -trave through undisterbed
            -deal a fixed amount of damage per second passing through player
     NOTE: waves only colider with forward edge (exempli gratia, if a player would enter the trail of a wave from the side, they do not take damage)
    
NOTE: players are aware of the positions of doors due to light streaming in accross the audiance
NOTE: it is important that the ratio of the audiance rectangle be different from the ratio of the stage rectangle, so that the waves bounce desirably.

-victory: a player looses the game when they loose all their health
    NOTE: player should have sufficient health to survive exactly 4 hits

The width and height of the audiance should each be roughly 6.5 times the width and height of the stage
The wave should increase in size by 1/4 its origional size in the time it takes it to cross the stage

===>> MAGIC NUMBERS: (Approx ratio game space units : pixels is 1 : 64) <<===
Stage should be 10 by 10 game space units
Character should be 1 by 1 game space units
Audiance should be 80 game space units by 60 game space units
Wave should travel 5 game space units / second
Wave should increase size 1 8th of a game unity / second #NOTE: we may want this to grow exponentially in the end
Wave should start at 1 game unit wide

FUTURE IDEAS:
Different types of waves:
    -dif Growth rate
    -dif Damage
    -dif Speed
    -dif Starting size
More interesting arena's than rectangle
