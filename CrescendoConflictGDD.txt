CRESCENDO CONFLICT GDD

-Players control Musical instraments duealing in a stage
    -may move up-down-left-right in a 2D top-down arena
        ->may only move freely in "stage" area
            -open rectangle in middle of stage
        ->may NOT move into "audiance" area
            -a larger rectangle around the stage 
    -may shoot musical waves in any of 360 degrees
        -always fire "forward" relative to character position

-Waves
    -move in a straing line until conlision
    -grow linearly with time
    -on colsion with:
        -door (predetermined parts of the outer edge of the audiance)
            -cease to exist
        -wall 
            ->bounce
        -other wave
            ->bounce
        -player character
            -trave through undisterbed
            -deal a fixed amount of damage per second passing through player
     NOTE: waves only colider with forward edge (exempli gratia, if a player would enter the trail of a wave from the side, they do not take damage)
    
NOTE: players are aware of the positions of doors due to light streaming in accross the audiance
NOTE: it is important that the ratio of the audiance rectangle be different from the ratio of the stage rectangle, so that the waves bounce desirably.
-victory: a player looses the game when they loose all their health

The width and height of the audiance should each be roughly 6.5 times the width and height of the stage
The wave should increase in size by 1/4 its origional size in the time it takes it to cross the stage
