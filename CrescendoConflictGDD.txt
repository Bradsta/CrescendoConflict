        ->may NOT move into "audiance" area
            -a larger rectangle around the stage 
    -may shoot musical waves in any of 360 degrees
        -always fire "forward" relative to character position

            -deal a fixed amount of damage per second passing through player
     NOTE: waves only colider with forward edge (exempli gratia, if a player would enter the trail of a wave from the side, they do not take damage)
    
NOTE: players are aware of the positions of doors due to light streaming in accross the audiance

-victory: a player looses the game when they loose all their health
