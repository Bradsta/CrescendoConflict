# InstruMENTAL

Instrumental is a 2 player arena brawler where animate musical instruments fight to the death with sound waves. Once a sound wave has been unleashed, it continues to echo around the arena, growing larger and damaging everyone it hits.

"‘Twas the ninth empty night in the concert hall, and the Conductor gave a deep sigh.
The Automaton Orchestra had lost its vogue, it seemed. To the trash heap it would go. And then a glorious idea crossed the Mad Conductor’s mind. With a gleam in his eye, and a flick of a switch, the he set the Automaton Orchestra to its new purpose. Such beautiful violence had never been heard. The concert hall would be empty no more, it seemed."

This game was created for the 2017 Global Game Jam. The theme was "Waves".
